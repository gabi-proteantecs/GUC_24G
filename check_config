Field Breakdown:
  Field Name               Bits    Hex    Dec Description
  tca_read                  [0]    0x0      0 When set, a read_data command triggers the readout from all Tile Connectivity Agents (TCAs and HBMAs) within the unit that received the command.
  tca_box_cfg_data       [15:0]   0xf2    242 Provides indirect write access to TCA box registers.
  tca_measure               [1]    0x1      1 When set, a measure command initiates measurement across all Tile Connectivity Agents (TCAs and HBMAs) within the processing unit (PU) that received the command.
  tca_read_mode           [3:2]    0x0      0 Specifies the TLV type used when reading the unit. Default: 0 (short readout with max-min values only), 1 (long readout including sum and count).
  tca_line_duration       [6:4]    0x7      7 Defines the duration for each delay buffer value as 2^(N+5) TCA clock cycles (1 GHz).
  tca_force_io_sensor_en    [7]    0x1      1 Force-enable bit to activate the sensor before initiating a measurement procedure.
